# MechaCar Statistical Analysis - Technical Analyses for MechaCar Data

AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, the data analytics team will do the following:

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Here are the results of our linear regression model to predict MPG based on the following metrics: vehicle weight and length, drivetrain, spoiler angle and ground clearance. 

#### Slope

#### Summary

The slope of the line is not zero because the p-values are under 0.05 (5.35e-11.) The ground clearance and vehicle length categories do have values under 0.05 and therefore provide some variance. The r-squared value is 0.7149. This means moderate-to-strong reliability of the model's prediction.
